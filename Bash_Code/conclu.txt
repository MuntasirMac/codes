Thank you for joining us!

Through each lesson, I have covered a some commands, analyzed some data, but most importantly, asked a few interesting questions and used command line tools to answer them. I’ve also introduced with a concise beginner friendly guide to the big data landscape including an overview of the critical Big Data tools such as HDFS, MapReduce, YARN, Flume, Hive and more.

With all the topics we discussed, you are now be well-equipped to do some data analysis of your own!
